I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bios/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). I obtained my PhD degree from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk) supervised by [Prof. Can Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/eeyangc/). My broad area of interest lies in statistical machine learning and data science with applications in genetics and genomics data. I have been working on scalable statistical methods for high dimensional regression problems, integrative analysis of multi-omics data, and cross-population genetics for association mapping and polygenic risk prediction.
