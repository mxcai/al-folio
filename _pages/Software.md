- VCM: 	An efficiently implemented R package for variance components estimation. The software provides 3 algorithms for fitting the variance components model, including the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the Minorization-Maximization algorithm, and the Method of Moments. Available at <https://github.com/mxcai/VCM>.
- XPASS: 	An R package for constructing genetic prediction of polygenic traits by leveraging cross-population datasets from GWAS summary data. Available at <https://github.com/mxcai/XPASS>.
- iGREX: 	An R package for the IGREX model that provides efficient quantification of the impact of genetically regulated expression on complex traits and diseases. Available at <https://github.com/mxcai/iGREX>.
- bivas: 	An R package for a scalable Bayesian bi-level variable selection model. Available at <https://github.com/mxcai/bivas>.
