- [VCM](https://github.com/mxcai/VCM): 	An efficiently implemented R package for variance components estimation. The software provides 3 algorithms for fitting the variance components model, including the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the Minorization-Maximization algorithm, and the Method of Moments.
- [XPASS](https://github.com/mxcai/XPASS): 	An R package for constructing genetic prediction of polygenic traits by leveraging cross-population datasets from GWAS summary data.
- [iGREX](https://github.com/mxcai/iGREX): 	An R package for the IGREX model that provides efficient quantification of the impact of genetically regulated expression on complex traits and diseases.
- [bivas](https://github.com/mxcai/bivas): 	An R package for a scalable Bayesian bi-level variable selection model.
